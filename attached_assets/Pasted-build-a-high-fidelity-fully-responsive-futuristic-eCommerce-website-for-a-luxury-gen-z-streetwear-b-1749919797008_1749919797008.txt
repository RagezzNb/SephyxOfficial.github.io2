build a high-fidelity, fully responsive futuristic eCommerce website for a luxury gen z streetwear brand called sephyx. the vibe should be next-gen, cyberpunk-coded, dark mode default with neon green, glitchy purple, and holographic fx. everything should scream high fashion x urban chaos. fonts used: orbitron for titles, satoshi or urbanist for body. the homepage must have a fullscreen autoplay video loop or glitchy image slider showing models in qatar urban environments wearing sephyx clothing. include overlays like floating particles, slow zooms, and cyberpunk distortions. tagline in large text: “drip designed for the future.” a glowing call-to-action button labeled “enter the vault” leads to the /shop page. the navbar should include a glitch-animated sephyx logo on the top left, with links to home, shop, lookbook, and account. include a glowing animated cursor with a star trail. enable a lo-fi trap beat playing in the background with a mute/unmute toggle. the shop page must have a clean grid layout with filters: hoodies, tees, bottoms, accessories. each product card must show a high-res image, name, price, size dropdown, and “add to cart” button. hovering on cards must cause a slight 3d tilt and neon glow. enable a quick view modal with full product info and model stats. when the cart icon is clicked, a slide-in cart drawer appears from the right with animated “item dropping” effects. pressing the “buy now” button should redirect to @sephyxofficial on instagram dms, auto-pasting this message: “yo sephyx, i want to order: - hoodie 'eclipse drift' | size m | qty: 1 - t-shirt 'neon dawn' | size l | qty: 2 total: qr ### name: phone: address: payment method: cash on delivery.” before redirection, show a popup warning: “⚠️ we only do cash on delivery in qatar.” no actual checkout, no stripe, no paypal, no backend payment integrations. all sales are through dms. add a “lookbook” page that shows cinematic fashion video lookbooks with trap overlays and hover-to-play previews. allow users to create an account using only email. users with accounts can see their loyalty points, order summaries, and saved outfits. the admin (gamingrage347@gmail.com) can assign loyalty points manually to accounts. loyalty levels include street starter, drip dealer, and sephyx saint. each level gives rewards like early access, hidden drops, or bonus items. include an admin portal at /admin for manual point control. add a hidden easter egg: if the user types “2025streetwear” anywhere on the site, unlock a secret /vault page. this vault includes unreleased products, an ar filter qr code, or discount codes. do not show this page in nav. include an outfit generator that randomly creates a fit using 2–3 items from the catalog. also add a “drip vision” feature where the user can upload a pic and get ai-recommended outfits (mock functionality is ok). users can also save their favorite outfits locally. on every product page, display a badge: “available only in qatar – cash on delivery.” site must be mobile-first, smooth as hell, and visually striking. transitions must be fluid with glitch fx. footer includes: instagram icon linking to @sephyxofficial, tiktok icon grayed out with “coming soon”, and text: “© 2025 sephyx. born in the streets of qatar. powered by drip.” the entire site must feel like a vault. sephyx isn’t just a brand, it’s a fucking digital street cult. do not include any templates, bootstrap, or bland ui kits. keep it raw, custom-coded, and dangerous. this entire website must prioritize style, speed, and seamless shopping through dms. the cart system can be powered by localstorage, and backend for user data is optional. the whole site must run without requiring any payment gateway or real-time order processing. the admin handles delivery after the dm. make this site god-tier in aesthetics, deadly in flow, and unstoppable in gen z energy. vault is real. loyalty is earned. sephyx runs the streets.
